Operating system function: supplying a user interface.
People require a means of interacting with any computer or similar device that is easier than communicating directly in the binary code of machine language that the computer uses internally.  What is most common now is the graphical user interface, which uses images and words (typically based on a metaphor of a desk on whose surface are arranged piles of documents and photographs in folders) to form a context for issuing instructions to the computer.  A text-based command-line interface is also available.

Operating system function: managing memory.
Memory has always been a limiting factor in the use of computers and similar devices.  Instructions and data are loaded into RAM while applications are running, and if there is not enough RAM available, part of the storage is used as virtual memory.  As long as the operating system manages the transitions smoothly, this will be satisfactory even though virtual memory is slower to access than RAM.  However, the computer may become increasingly difficult to use if there is too much pressure on the memory, not least because the operating system itself needs memory.

Operating system function: establishing an internet connection.
Accessing the internet while using a computer or similar device has become the default, and it now requires intentional effort to turn off online access.  Once upon a time, when online access was by means of a dial-up modem over a telephone line, it was necessary for the user to establish an internet connection at the beginning of a session, often to reestablish it more than once during the session, and to close the connection when the session finished.  Now, after an initial setup of the internet account when the computer is first purchased, the operating system will establish and maintain an internet connection, often wirelessly, behind the scenes, with very little or no further attention required.
