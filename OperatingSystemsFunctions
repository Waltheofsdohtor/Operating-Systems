Operating system function: supplying a user interface.
People require a means of interacting with any computer or similar device that is easier than communicating directly in the binary code of machine language that the computer uses internally.  What is most common now is the graphical user interface, which uses images and words (typically based on a metaphor of a desk on whose surface are arranged piles of documents and photographs in folders) to form a context for issuing instructions to the computer.  A text-based command-line interface is also available.
